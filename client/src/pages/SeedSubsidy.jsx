        The Indian government provides export subsidies to promote the
        competitiveness of its goods and services in the global market. These
        incentives aim to offset domestic production costs and encourage
        exporters to expand their international reach. Key export subsidy
        schemes include the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) and the
        Service Exports from India Scheme (SEIS), which offer duty credit scrips
        to exporters. Additionally, initiatives like interest equalization on
        pre- and post-shipment rupee export credit and exemptions or reductions
        in customs duties on imported inputs further support India's export
        sector. However, some of these subsidies have faced challenges under
        World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, prompting reforms and adjustments
        in recent years.
