        The fertilizer subsidy in India is a government initiative to make
        fertilizers more affordable for farmers, ensuring that agricultural
        inputs remain accessible and promoting higher crop yields. The subsidy
        reduces the cost of fertilizers like urea, phosphatic, and potassic
        fertilizers, with the government compensating manufacturers for selling
        these at lower, regulated prices. This support aims to boost
        agricultural productivity, food security, and the overall economy, but
        it also puts a significant strain on the national budget.
